# Battle Game
The "Battle-Game" is the first group Python project we've done during our first year in college.
This is a simple turn-based strategy game implemented in Python.
Players can choose to play against each other (user vs. user) or against an AI (user vs. AI).
It took little less than a month to finish the project.

## Features
- User vs. User mode: Players take turns controlling units and battling each other until one team is victorious.
- User vs. AI mode: Players face off against an AI opponen that makes strategic decisions based on the game state.
- Customizable unit classes: Players can choose from different types of units with unique attributes and abilities.
- Game logging: The game logs every action and outcome, including timestamps, to a file named "GameLog.txt".

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/kcrmin/Battle-Game.git
   ```

2. Run the game:
   ```bash
   python Battle-Game.py
   ```

## Usage
1. Choose the game mode: User vs. User or User vs. AI.
2. Select the units for each team.
3. Follow the prompts to play the game, taking turns controlling units and battling opponents.
4. Review the game log in the "GameLog.txt" file to see a detailed record of the game.
